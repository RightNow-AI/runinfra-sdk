# Agent 4 Goal: SDK Production Stability

Date: 2026-05-23
Agent: 4
Repo: `runinfra-sdk`
Branch/PR: `hardening/sdk-ga-canary-gates`, PR `RightNow-AI/runinfra-sdk#9`

## Goal

Move TS/Python SDKs from secure beta to production-grade GA. Done means clean npm/PyPI installs, live contract match, strict artifact canaries, protected PR merge, OIDC/provenance release, and no leakage of secrets, source maps, internal source, private config, local paths, caches, or fixtures.

Agent 4 owns SDK hardening, package safety, live contract proof, and release evidence. Read state first, patch narrowly, test artifacts, get review for risky changes, and never claim production-ready with skipped or unverified canaries.

## Verified State

- Local `main` carries PR #9 commits; verify exact ahead count with `git status`.
- PR checks are green: TS SDK, Python SDK, CodeQL/default code scanning, package/build/test gates.
- Branch protection is active: merge is blocked by `REVIEW_REQUIRED`; current auth user cannot self-approve.
- Code scanning showed 0 open alerts and 0 open high/critical alerts. Default branch still has 3 moderate Dependabot alerts.
- Current RunPipe canary env proves gateway/auth/request-id/models-list shape only. It lacks live model IDs/audio fixtures, so strict GA is incomplete.
- `/models` returns a valid object with empty `data`; shape proof only, not model coverage.
- Registry install/import gate is enforced after real publish. Local proof: `verify-clean-installs --mode registry --version 0.1.3` passed for npm/PyPI 0.1.3.
- Strict preflight writes redacted readiness reports without live calls; fake-key proof showed blocked readiness, 0 child reports, and no key leak.

## Production Bar

- Registry consumer installs verify imports and versions for npm and PyPI.
- SDKs cover/document chat, responses, embeddings, images, TTS, ASR, voice pipeline, streaming, errors, idempotency, request IDs, retries, and fail-closed webhooks.
- OpenAI-compatible calls prove supported parameters and clear unsupported errors without hiding auth, credit, rate-limit, model, or deployment failures.
- Strict artifact canaries pass with no required skips for LLM, responses, embeddings, image, TTS, ASR, voice, streaming final/cancel, idempotency replay, error shape, and install/import.
- Package scans prove no source maps, `.env`, `.npmrc`, secrets, local paths, private config, caches, fixtures, or internal files.

## Remaining Blockers

1. Need non-author approval before PR #9 can merge into protected `main`.
2. Strict canary env is missing model IDs, embedding dimensions, image/TTS/ASR/voice coverage, audio fixtures, expected transcripts, and idempotency enablement.
3. Advanced OpenAI proof still needs tools/schema outputs, stream options, image/audio variants, embedding dimensions/base64, and model-specific options.
4. Python GA choice remains open: ship `AsyncRunInfra` or document sync-only as intentional.
5. Webhook delivery create/list stays fail-closed until real delivery endpoints exist.

## Guardrails

Inspect git/PR/checks before claims. Fix only GA-linked contract, security, packaging, canary, or docs gaps. Verify tests, type/build, scans, clean installs, and source/artifact canaries. Review changes over 2 files, over 100 lines, or release/architecture decisions. Merge only through protected PR after non-author approval. Publish only via trusted workflow after merge and strict canary proof. Do not bypass protection, self-approve, force-push `main`, weaken checks/tests, use pasted registry tokens, ship source maps/internal bundles, or run destructive git reconciliation.

## Next Checkpoint

Collect strict production canary env/fixtures, then rerun preflight and artifact canaries until every required SDK path is proven.

## 2026-05-23 Agent 4 Checkpoint

Added release-gate hardening:

- Strict preflight now blocks invalid or non-finite `RUNINFRA_CANARY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` before live canaries run.
- Workflow policy now checks npm and PyPI publish jobs separately for OIDC `id-token: write` and environment mapping, while the CLI verifier always reads the real workflow files.
- Registry clean-install verification now pins npm to `https://registry.npmjs.org/` and PyPI to `https://pypi.org/simple` instead of inheriting alternate indexes; polluted local registry env was tested.

Fresh local verification:

- TS tests passed, 112 tests.
- Python tests passed, 101 tests plus 88 subtests.
- TS typecheck/build passed.
- Workflow policy and version sync passed.
- Registry install/import passed for npm/PyPI version `0.1.3`.
- Code scanning open alerts: 0. Open high/critical alerts: 0.
- Second-opinion review initially blocked on non-finite timeout and redirectable workflow-file env hooks; both were fixed.

Current blockers remain:

- PR #9 is still blocked by `REVIEW_REQUIRED`.
- Strict preflight is blocked: 6 ready rows, 18 blocked rows, no child reports.
- Missing live inputs still include API key, model IDs, embedding dimensions, image/TTS/ASR/voice fixtures, expected transcripts, pipeline ID/key, and idempotency opt-in.

## 2026-05-23 Agent 4 Checkpoint: Webhook Export Canary Coverage

Added release-gate coverage for the top-level webhook helper exports in both SDKs:

- Strict canary matrix now includes `webhooks.verify_signature.export` and `webhooks.construct_event.export`.
- TypeScript source canary now calls exported `verifyWebhookSignature` and `constructWebhookEvent` directly.
- Python source canary now calls exported `verify_webhook_signature` and `construct_webhook_event` directly.
- `LIVE-CANARIES.md` documents that webhook verification rows cover both client-attached helpers and top-level package exports.

Fresh local verification:

- Added failing TS preflight assertion first; it failed because the two export rows were absent.
- TS tests passed, 112 tests.
- Python tests passed, 101 tests plus 88 subtests.
- TS typecheck and build passed.
- Workflow policy, version sync, Python canary syntax, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Source canary report passed parity: TypeScript 8 passed/18 skipped, Python 8 passed/18 skipped.
- Strict preflight remains intentionally blocked but improved to 8 ready rows and 18 blocked rows.

Current blockers remain:

- PR #9 still needs non-author approval before protected merge.
- Strict live canaries still require scoped production canary env and fixtures for LLM, embeddings, image, TTS, ASR, voice pipeline, and idempotency.
- This checkpoint proves more local public helper surface, not live multimodal GA readiness.

## 2026-05-23 Agent 4 Checkpoint: Audio Binary Interface Canary Coverage

Added a TTS binary-interface row to the strict canary matrix:

- New row: `audio.speech.binary_interfaces`.
- TypeScript canary now validates `RunInfraAudioResponse.blob()` and `RunInfraAudioResponse.stream()` using real TTS calls when live TTS env is present.
- Existing `audio.speech.create` continues to validate `arrayBuffer()`.
- Python canary validates its raw `AudioResponse.content` byte surface under the same TTS readiness gate.
- `LIVE-CANARIES.md` now documents the language-specific binary response coverage.

Fresh local verification:

- Added failing TS preflight assertion first; it failed because `audio.speech.binary_interfaces` was absent.
- Review found the initial TS stream drain could hang after headers; fixed by bounding each raw stream read with `RUNINFRA_CANARY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, canceling the reader on timeout/error, and adding a regression assertion against bare `reader.read()`.
- TS tests passed, 113 tests.
- Python tests passed, 101 tests plus 88 subtests.
- TS typecheck and build passed.
- Workflow policy, version sync, Python canary syntax, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Source canary report passed parity: TypeScript 8 passed/19 skipped, Python 8 passed/19 skipped, expected rows 27.
- Strict preflight remains intentionally blocked: 8 ready rows and 19 blocked rows.

Current blockers remain:

- This does not prove live TTS until `RUNINFRA_TTS_MODEL` plus voice or reference-audio inputs are supplied.
- Strict live canaries still require scoped production canary env and fixtures for the broader multimodal matrix.

## 2026-05-23 Agent 4 Checkpoint: Image OpenAI Parameter Canary Coverage

Added a strict image parameter row for OpenAI-compatible image output coverage:

- New row: `openai.params.images`.
- Strict readiness now tracks `RUNINFRA_IMAGE_SIZE` and `RUNINFRA_IMAGE_RESPONSE_FORMAT`.
- TypeScript and Python canaries now send `size` plus `response_format` and assert exact image output matching for `url` versus `b64_json`.
- TS/Python READMEs and `LIVE-CANARIES.md` now document the live-gated image parameter row.

Fresh local verification:

- Added failing TS preflight assertion first; it failed because `openai.params.images` was absent.
- Review noted that image dimensions are not exposed in the response, so the row cannot prove the backend honored `size`; docs now state that size is sent under a strict readiness gate while `response_format` is asserted exactly.
- TS tests passed, 113 tests.
- Python tests passed, 101 tests plus 88 subtests.
- TS typecheck and build passed.
- Workflow policy, version sync, Python canary syntax, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Source canary report passed parity: TypeScript 8 passed/20 skipped, Python 8 passed/20 skipped, expected rows 28.
- Strict preflight remains intentionally blocked: 8 ready rows and 20 blocked rows.

Current blockers remain:

- This does not prove live image parameter support until `RUNINFRA_IMAGE_MODEL`, `RUNINFRA_IMAGE_SIZE`, and `RUNINFRA_IMAGE_RESPONSE_FORMAT` are supplied for a deployed image backend.
- Strict live canaries still require scoped production canary env and fixtures for the broader multimodal matrix.
